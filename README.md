# DroneLib - Physics-based Drone Simulation Library

DroneLib is a Python library that provides a comprehensive framework for simulating the physics and predicting the movement of bimotored RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems). This library enables accurate and realistic simulations of drone behavior, allowing you to gain insights into the dynamics and performance of drones in various scenarios.

## Features

- Accurate Physics Modeling: DroneLib utilizes advanced physics equations to model the behavior of bimotored RPAS, taking into account factors such as aerodynamic forces, rotational dynamics, and environmental conditions.

- Customizable Parameters: Easily define specific parameters for your drone, including mass, thrust coefficients, drag coefficients, and more, to accurately approximate the movement and predict the physics of bimotored RPAS.

- Simulation and Analysis: With DroneLib, you can simulate the flight of your drone, analyze its stability, evaluate performance under different conditions, and make informed decisions based on accurate predictions and insights.

## Installation

DroneLib can be installed using pip. Simply run the following command:

```
pip install dronelib
```


## Usage

To start using DroneLib in your Python project, import the necessary modules and create an instance of the `Drone` class. Then, you can set the parameters of your drone, such as mass, thrust coefficients, and drag coefficients. Finally, use the simulation functions provided by DroneLib to simulate the drone's movement and analyze its behavior.

Here's a simple example:

```python
from dronelib import Drone

# Create a drone instance
drone = Drone()

# Set drone parameters
drone.mass = 1.0
drone.thrust_coefficient = 0.1
drone.drag_coefficient = 0.01

# Simulate drone movement
drone.simulate_flight(time=10.0)  # Simulate for 10 seconds

# Analyze drone behavior
drone.analyze_stability()
drone.evaluate_performance()
```
